Task 2 of the Advanced AI Module 



Task 2 :  Develop a prototype game (in Unity – same version as in labs)  that demonstrates the integration of the Perception System with either a Behaviour Tree,  HTN or GOAP. The systems may be based on the HTN or GOAP frameworks developed within the practicals but you can optionally develop your own (you will have to in the case of the BT). If developing your own, it should conform to generally understood principles of their design. The prototype can be of any genre/projection but must demonstrate the ability to make decisions based on the current world state. Your systems should be tested thoroughly and these tests must be documented. To simplify this task you may optionally develop a game prototype that outputs the agent’s behaviour as text, rather than an animated behaviour. This could be implemented by displaying a different text message for each of the actions the agent performs. 
Hint: First select the behaviour system you wish to integrate the perception system with. Then implement some basic actions that provides the agent with two or three alternative behaviours/goals. Once this is running correctly integrate the perception system, which will change the world state used to determine which actions the agent should execute. If taking a text output approach the stimuli could be hard coded into the prototype (60%).
